# Web-programs

This repo contains the source codes of the websites that I have developed including frontend, backend or both with the help while completing this web development [bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). ***Results*** of the ***developed*** *websites* that are accessible publicly can be found [here](https://aurimas13.github.io/Web-programs/), [here](https://serene-refuge-72822.herokuapp.com/) and [here](https://desolate-bastion-00330.herokuapp.com/). Currently GitHub pages includes **Simon Game** while the server contains simple subscription **Newsletter-Signup** program and a completed **To Do List program**. The relevant files (**index.html**, **game.js**, **styles.css**) to access GitHub pages are updated and duplicated in the repo's main branch, while the [*Newsletter-Signup*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Newsletter-Signup) and [*Todolist*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Todolist-complete) programs contain source codes under their GitHub links. More on the developed thingies can be found under the [Developed](#Developed) section where short descriptions of the projects are also provided.
