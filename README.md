The folder contains various website source codes that I am developing or already has been developed. It consists of [**Dice** *website*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Dice_website) (a frontend website for the game of dice that can be played by refreshing), [**Drum Kit** *website*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Drum_Kit_website) (pressing buttons of w,a,s,d,j,k,l give sounds as if while playing a drum; this is a frontend website), [**Simon Game**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Simon%20Game) (the recently developed frontend website and game), [**TinDog** *website*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/TinDog_website) (a visually pleasant frontend website including bootstrap), [DOM intro website](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Learning_websites/DOM_Intro_website) (nothing special, just intro to DOM), [my-express](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Servers/my-express) (intro to the usage of express framework), [**Calculator**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Servers/Calculator) (backend implementation that adds two numbers and also calculates BMI), [**Weather Project**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/WeatherProject) (mostly backend implementation of forecasting a weather for a specific location through open weather API) and [**Newsletter-Signup**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Newsletter-Signup) (backend and frontend implementation of a newsletter subscription; to be used in my ***personal website*** accessed through [this](https://github.com/aurimas13/Personal-website)) while the simple subscription website to sign up can be accessed through [here](https://serene-refuge-72822.herokuapp.com/). Backend frameworks such as express were used for the development of *Calculator*, *WeatherProject* and *Newsleter-Signup* local websites. This framework now could easily be replaced by other frameworks like Koa as express runs the risk of becoming out-of-date.
