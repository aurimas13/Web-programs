# Web-programs

This repo contains the source codes of the websites that are either developed or under development including frontend, backend or both with the help while doing this web development [bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/). ***Always updated result*** of either the ***developed*** *website* or the *website* under the *development* can be found [here](https://aurimas13.github.io/Web-programs/), [here](https://serene-refuge-72822.herokuapp.com/) and [here](https://desolate-bastion-00330.herokuapp.com/). Currently GitHub pages includes **Simon Game** while the server contains simple subscription **Newsletter-Signup** program and a completed **To Do List program**. The relevant files (**index.html**, **game.js**, **styles.css**) to access GitHub pages are updated and duplicated in the repo's main branch, while the [*Newsletter-Signup*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Newsletter-Signup) and [*Todolist*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Todolist-complete) programs contain source codes under this GitHub repository. More on the developed thingies through the web bootcamp can be found under [Developed](#Developed) section.

The folder contains various website source codes that I am developing or already has been developed. It consists of [**Dice** *website*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Dice_website) (a frontend website for the game of dice that can be played by refreshing), [**Drum Kit** *website*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Drum_Kit_website) (pressing buttons of w,a,s,d,j,k,l give sounds as if while playing a drum; this is a frontend website), [**Simon Game**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Simon%20Game) (the recently developed frontend website and game), [**TinDog** *website*](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/TinDog_website) (a visually pleasant frontend website including bootstrap), [DOM intro website](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Learning_websites/DOM_Intro_website) (nothing special, just intro to DOM), [my-express](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Servers/my-express) (intro to the usage of express framework), [**Calculator**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Servers/Calculator) (backend implementation that adds two numbers and also calculates BMI), [**Weather Project**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/WeatherProject) (mostly backend implementation of forecasting a weather for a specific location through open weather API), [**Newsletter-Signup**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Newsletter-Signup) (backend and frontend implementation of a newsletter subscription; to be used in my ***personal website*** accessed through [this](https://github.com/aurimas13/Personal-website)), [**Todolist-testing**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Todolist-testing) (mainly backend implementation with additional new features learnt), [**Blog-project**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Blog-project) (implementation of front end and backend for designing a random blog) and [**Todolist-complete**](https://github.com/aurimas13/Web-programs/tree/main/Developed/Todolist-complete) (final full-stack implementation of todolist program/website). The simple subscription website to sign up can be accessed through [here](https://serene-refuge-72822.herokuapp.com/). Backend frameworks such as express were used for the development of *Calculator*, *WeatherProject*, *Newsleter-Signup* and *Todolist* websites. This framework now could easily be replaced by other frameworks like Koa as express runs the risk of becoming out-of-date.
